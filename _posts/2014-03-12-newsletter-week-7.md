Hello everyone, it’s week 7! That means that it is time for another SSE newsletter!

The past two weeks have been busy, between weekly projects meetings, career fair week company visits, and a couple other events, it’s been pretty busy in the lab! Intuit, Moog, Constant Contact, UTC Aerospace, Datto, and Aerotek have all visited the lab in the previous two weeks!

## Upcoming Events
Friday from 4pm to 5pm Projects committee has a general meeting with all the projects to discuss ImagineRIT. If you’re curious about any projects, it’s a perfect time to meet the people involved and insert yourself into a team!

Also this Friday we have a Tech Talk on Obscure Objective-C given by our very own Michael Timbrook.

Thanks to a closing, next Wednesday (the 19th) we have Powerpoint Karaoke in the lab from 7pm to 8:30pm! If you submit a slideshow, you will be awarded membership! Show up and watch people give presentations they had absolutely no preparation for! It’ll be awesome!

The Skating with Women in Computing event has been moved to next week! Women in Computing is sponsoring ice time at the Ritter ice arena and has been kind enough to invite us! The event is free, but you’ll have to pay for your own ice skate rentals. Stay tuned to our social networks ([http://sse.se.rit.edu/social](http://sse.se.rit.edu/social)) for an exact time and date!

## SSE Constitution Bug Fixing
We have an ongoing vote in progress to amend the SSE Constitution. The change allows members who will be eligible in the fall but don’t currently meet the year requirement to run – this was possible under our old constitution and is considered a regression and should be fixed.

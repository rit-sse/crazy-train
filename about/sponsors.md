The SSE is supported by many outstanding organizations and companies, whether by feeding our members at meetings, sending us gifts to raffle at events, or through donations that help keep us running. Some of the companies we've worked with include:

* [Amazon][1]
* [Apple][2]
* [Brand Networks][3]
* [GitHub][4]
* [Google][5]
* [Microsoft][6]
* [Northrup Grumman][7]
* [UTC Aerospace][8]

We'd also like to thank Countersoft for letting us use their Gemini [issue tracking software][9].

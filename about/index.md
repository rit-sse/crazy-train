title: About The SSE

### What we're all about

The Society of Software Engineers (SSE) is a student organization at RIT composed
of software engineers, computer scientists, and other students. We have over
fifty active members that participate in mentoring, software projects, intramural
sports, and social events. The SSE has strong relationships with companies like
Microsoft, Google, Apple, Northrup Grumman, Goodrich, IBM, and Oracle. We work
closely with companies in the software industry to provide our members with
potential career opportunities.


### What we do

Our lab [(GOL-1670)][6] is open for mentoring on weekdays from 10:00AM to 6:00PM
and any student, can come and ask questions for any class in the Software
Engineering curriculum. The [Mentoring Committee][1] offers 1-on-1 tutoring and
holds practice exams for popular computer science and software engineering classes.

The SSE also hosts many fun [events][3] throughout the year. Our biggest event is
the SSE Winter Ball where we decorate the GCCIS atrium and open up the event to all RIT
students - it's a smash hit! We also go out camping and barbecuing, we watch movies 
together, we go on trips around Rochester, and many other exciting activities.
In addition, the SSE has many intramural sports teams that play throughout the academic year.

We also hosts the very popular [Voices in Software Engineering (ViSE)][4] 
speaker series. We've previously brought in speakers like Bjarne Stoustrup (the 
original author of the C++ programming language) and Alan Atlas (a certified 
Scrum trainer).

The [projects committee][2] is a recent addition to the society, but it is by no 
means the smallest. In the projects committee, SSE members come together and work on 
software engineering projects for fun and research. Our current and past projects
include a singing tesla coil, a web-controllable slideshow for our TV displays,
and a large multitouch wall. In addition, the first weekend of winter and spring quarters, 
many SSE members come together for Rapid Development Weekend where a medium-sized 
software project is executed from requirements to testing and release all in one 
weekend. Previous Rapid Development projects include a capture the flag computer
game, an anonymous file transfer system, and an adventure game resembling Pokémon.


### Get involved

Although we may be biased, the members of the SSE are friendly and enjoy 
meeting new people. So by all means please stop by the lab sometime! 
We’d love to get to know you!

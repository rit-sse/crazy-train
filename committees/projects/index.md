## Active Projects

### Voxel Display Research
Jesse Jurman is heading off research - with the help of the Imaging Science department - to create a voxel display. Running with the momentum of last year’s Volumetric Display, we are continuing to explore 3D technologies from both a hardware and software perspective. If you’d like to help design the prototype, contact Jesse Jurman or projects for more information!
